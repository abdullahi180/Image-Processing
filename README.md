# Image-Processing

Historical document images are more problematic to binarize than modern scanned documents, due
to the fact that it has degraded, and it has low contrast. Document binarization is essential for
information acquisition. Document image binarization is the process that segments an image into
text and non-text by removing any existing degradations. Itâ€™s an essential pre-processing phase of
the document image processing and analysis pipeline that affects further stages as well as the final
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) stage (K. Ntirogiannis et al, 2014). This is an essential when
processing of such historical documents. Image binarization is method in which we can remove noise
from an image, which then enables the document to become more meaningful and give us a better
understanding. 

The report focuses on thresholding using Niblacks method. Additionally, there are 
evaluations of numerous images to show the effect of the algorithm, whilst also comparing it to the
ground truth image.
